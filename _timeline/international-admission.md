Students travelling to Edinburgh who aren't from the UK, EU (&amp; EEA) or Switzerland 
may need to apply for a *student visa*.

If you are a national of an EU/EEA country, or Switzerland, you do not need to apply for permission to live, work or study in the UK. 

You should travel to the UK using your EU/EEA/Swiss passport or national ID card and there will be no restriction on studying.
