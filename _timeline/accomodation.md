Accomodation applications are handled separately from admissions; You'll have to decide on 
whether you wish to apply for the University's *Halls of Residence* or find accomodation on your own.

#### University Accomodation

There are options of both *catered* accomodation at **Pollock Halls** and *self catered* accomodation in flats and halls around the city.

#### Private Housing

It is normal for students to rent on the public property market after their first year, though 
it is fine to do this in your first year too. 

Most Students try and live close to Central campus, in Marchmont, Newington, Bruntsfield and Tollcross.
