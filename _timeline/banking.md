#### UK Students

It is a good idea to have a bank account set-up as it allows for you to directly receive student finance and payment of tuition fees, if applicable. Many banks offer accounts tailored to the needs of students.

#### Non-UK Students

Most students studying for more than one semester are usually able to open a bank account.

#### Visiting Students (One Semester Only)

Visits of such a short length offer a limited range of suitable banking solutions. It may be worth your time contacting banks directly that will accept your business; Bank of Scotland or Barclay Bank for instance.
