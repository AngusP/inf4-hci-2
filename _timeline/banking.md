<h4>UK Students</h4>
It is a good idea to have a bank account set-up as it allows for you to directly receive student finance and payment of tuition fees, if applicable. Many banks offer accounts tailored to the needs of students.

<h4>Non-UK Students</h4>
Most students studying for more than one semester are usually able to open a bank account.

<h4>Visiting Students</h4>

<strong>(One Semester Only)</strong><br>

Visits of such a short length offer a limited range of suitable banking solutions. It may be worth your time contacting banks directly that will accept your business; Bank of Scotland or Barclays Bank for instance.
