Each student needs to matriculate, which formally admits you to the University. 

#### Register on MyEd

The University's online portal, [MyEd](https://www.myed.ed.ac.uk/), includes a registration form that must be completed.

#### Confirm Attendance

You must confirm your attendance with your School/College. This varies by degree programme, so this information will be supplied to you.

#### Fulfil Admissions Criteria

If specified in your admissions letter, such criteria must be met to be admitted to the University.

#### Student Card

Each student is required to have an up-to-date student card, which serves as identification and provides access to university facilities such as the library. Information regarding applying for and collecting the card can be obtained from [Information Services](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/card/getting-first-card).
