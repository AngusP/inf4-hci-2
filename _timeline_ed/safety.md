Edinburgh is a safe city with a low crime rate, but you must ensure that you take your own personal safety into account.

**Emergency services can be reached by dialling 999.** Non-emergencies can be reported by dialling 101.

#### While Travelling

Make sure that you produce copies of and keep your passport, visa and travel documents safe. Don't carry excess amounts of cash and valuables, especially if you will not be with your luggage, such as checking your luggage for a flight.

#### In Your Accommodation

Keep your valuables out of sight and make sure that your doors and windows are locked, especially when you are not present. For unexpected and unknown visitors, ask for them to present identification, to ensure that you do not allow fraudulent visitors in to your accommodation.

#### Moving Around the City

Don't walk home at night. Make sure that you plan ahead and try to stay with friends. Be sure to keep aware of your surroundings. Black cabs are a safe mode of transport for getting you home, especially if you do not know the area.
