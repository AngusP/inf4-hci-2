Most degree programmes provide a level of flexibility in what courses you can take 
over the course of a semester or year.

Once you;ve made your selection, you'll need to confirm your choices with your PT. 

#### Path & DRPS

**Path** is an interactive course selection builder; listed will be mandatory courses 
and the range of courses that are available to your degree programme. These are not 
necessarily limited to your degree's school or college. (Note your selection is *not* 
automatically conferred to your Personal Tutor)

**DRPS** (Degree Regulations and Programmes of Study) provides a wealth of information about courses.
It can be confusing to navigate at first, but is the official source of programme information.
