Edinburgh has Busses, Trams and Taxis (Black Cab and hireable like Uber). 
Busses are mostly run by *Lothian Busses*, some other services are also available.
The Trams mostly cover *New Town*, with routes out to the Western Subburbs and the Airport.

    Buying a bus pass ('Ridacard') is significantly cheaper than singles if you
    use the busses a lot.
