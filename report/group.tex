%% REQUIREMENTS %%

\section{Topics}

% The topic(s) you decided to cover in the website. What kind of information 
% you were trying to convey. 

\section{Design Motivation}

% Reasoning behind why the website is usable. This section will likely include 
% the outcome of any evaluations you conducted. Unlike the last coursework I do 
% not expect you to do a full formal analysis and description. A few sentences 
% on the method you used is fine. The key is providing reasoning on either why 
% the site is usable, or what you changed to make it so.

\section{Reflection}

% Reflection paragraph: what you have learned from completing this coursework. 
% What worked, what didn't, and if you could go back and do this coursework 
% again what might you do differently the next time.


\section{Tools and Templates}

%% REQUIREMENTS %%
% A list of any tools or templates you used to construct the website.

\section*{Mark Allocation}

%% REQUIREMENTS %%

% How the group would like me to allocate marks. Two options: 1) everybody gets 
% the same mark, 2) a clear list of who is responsible for which part of the 
% website or evaluation. In the case of #2 10 points will be marked group wide 
% for the general design of the website and the remaining 40 points will be marked 
% based on the individual portion of the work.

1) Everybody gets the same mark
